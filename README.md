# YouTubeDlgGui

This is a simple dialog that allows you to download videos from YouTube using [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).
# How to run
Just download the precompiled binary from the release tab.
<br>
<br>
Of course you could also build the application using dotnet.
```shell
dotnet publish -c release -r {os} -p:PublishSingleFile=true --self-contained true --verbosity Normal -p:PublishTrimmed=True -p:EnableCompressionInSingleFile=true -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true
```
Replace {os} with your operating system (linux-x64|win-x64|osx-x64)
